Rpi
===

half baked code
 The code contained in this repository is intentionally only partially functional.
 The goal is give people the opportunity to extend the code. 
 
 The Raspberry Pi was created for the purposes of educating, so to that end I don't upload 100% complete code.
 
 The comments in the files should help you understand what is happening, and further research should solidify 
 your understanding of the code. 
 
 Have fun!
